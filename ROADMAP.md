# Chorus Roadmap

> Living plan for what's shipping. Owns the cross-version product story so nothing gets lost during repo migrations or version cuts.

---

## Core product insight

Chorus's depth comes from a three-axis combinatorial:

```
Voices  ×  Personas  ×  Phases
```

- **Voices** — the model behind the keyboard. CLI subscriptions (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, Kimi) and API-routed models (anything reachable via OpenRouter, Anthropic API, etc.). Each voice has a lineage tag (anthropic / openai / google / moonshot / deepseek / meta / mistral / xai).
- **Personas** — the *role* a reviewer plays. A system prompt + worldview. Same model produces wildly different output as Sentinel (security) vs Cartographer (cross-platform) vs Accountant (cost).
- **Phases** — the position in the pipeline. Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver, Debate, Decide. User can add, remove, reorder.

A **template** is a chosen path through this 3D space — N phases, each with a (voice, persona) pair. Different combinations produce wildly different outcomes. Users will experiment to find what works for their domain (Rails refactor, React perf, Solidity audit, copy review, …) and share what wins.

This is the seed of the **template marketplace**: an asset class that didn't exist before chorus.

| Persona registry — table + 10 built-ins + seed loader | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | |
| MCP `list_personas` + `invoke_persona` | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | 9 MCP tools total |
| Voices abstraction (table + auto-populate + 6 UI surfaces) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #2 c758e80); 71 voices auto-seed across 5 lineages; vendor_family taxonomy |
| libsql migration (better-sqlite3 → @libsql/client, no node-gyp) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #1 1441532); fixes `npm install -g` on Windows / locked-down boxes |
| Review-only mode (artifact in, no doer; substrate + cockpit + verdict persistence) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #4 b21a4b8); unlocks `/work` & MCP harnesses calling chorus as a pure review service |
| Per-phase `timeoutMs` override (round-2-deferred §2) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #5 9a47f23); 30s..1h schema bound, threaded through doer + reviewer + tmux + review-only synthesis |
| Token-capture rails (round-2-deferred §1) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #8 3910607); `AgentEvent.message_done.usage` + capture in doer return shape — per-lineage parser updates + DB persistence + cost math are follow-ups |
| Opt-out telemetry heartbeat (round-2-deferred §4) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #6 bac7445); daemon-side ping to chorus.codes once on boot + every 24h; three opt-out paths; server endpoint deploy + privacy notice are separate infra tasks |
| Structured JSON-line logger substrate (round-2-deferred §3) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #7 7ce6b46); pino-shaped wire format (level/time/pid/hostname); 5 first-class call sites; mechanical migration of remaining ~50 console sites is a follow-up |
| Codex quota_exhausted detection + `CHORUS_CODEX_HOME` override | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #9 ee7b5fb); codex emits `ERROR: hit your usage limit` to stderr and exits 1, parseCodexExit now reads stderr+code and emits `error{kind:'quota_exhausted'}` instead of writing 0-byte answer.md. Round-1 review-only dogfood caught the regex was too loose (codex echoes user prompt to stderr → false-positive risk); fixed by anchoring on literal `ERROR:` prefix. Env override is a stopgap; proper UX is multi-account-per-CLI in v0.8. |
| SSE hijack + backpressure drain race + init log path | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #13 a5f6db1); fastify `reply.hijack()` before `reply.raw` writes, drain handler clears `paused` first then flushes, `chorus init` log honours `CHORUS_DB_PATH`. cdx-1 round-2 follow-ups from libsql migration. |
| Cockpit retry button + correct reviewer count | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #14 0ab62e4) |
| Templates `liveYaml` precedence test coverage | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #15 02e0820) — Fix C from PR #10 |
| Time + token chips on participant cards | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #16 b1e2f09); reads from `_stats.json` sidecar |
| Personas wire into doer + reviewer slots (per-slot binding) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #17 969dca5); each phase row carries its own persona — removes the §1 "one-persona-overlay-on-all-voices" limitation |
| CLI orphan reap on `chorus stop` + `start` | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #18 3eaf166) |
| `/rerun` server-side guard + retry button surfaces ok:false | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #19 a682e14) |
| Persona injection fence + missing-persona warning + stats SSE cleanup | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #20 0758791); emits `cli_warning{kind:'persona_missing'}` on lookup failure |
| Auto-fire chat runner on POST /chats (closes deferred #11) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #21 b372bec); MCP-driven flows no longer sit `drafting` until a human opens the URL — runChat fires immediately on POST, SSE becomes a passive subscriber on a per-chat event bus that replays from `phase_events`. |
| MCP `wait_for_chat` progress-notification keepalive | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #22 1940964); `notifications/progress` every 30s past Anthropic's 60s default tool timeout |
| Per-slot persona picker in PhaseEditor UI | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #23 4ac8cdc); completes the per-phase persona-binding UX from PR #17 |
| Per-card cancel button + per-runner AbortController | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #24 58603b6); cancel a single voice mid-run without killing the chat |
| Surface opencode + kimi token usage in message_done | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-02 (PR #25 15b219a); per-lineage parser updates aggregating `step_finish` events session-wide |
| `cli_warning` banner + USD cost on participant card | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-03 (PR #26 3ff046c); compounds with #25 token aggregation — opencode multi-step cost summed independently of token parsing so a malformed-tokens-but-valid-cost step still bills correctly |
| OpenRouter inline flow (validate → fetch models → multi-add) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | merged 2026-05-03 (PR #27 9934852); validate / catalog / insert flow + cockpit page. Per-pricing per-Mtok USD math; voice id format `openrouter:<model-id>`; `classifyOpencodeModel` reused for lineage classification. Self-review caught two follow-ups (defensive pagination + apiKey plumb-through) shipped in same PR. |
| HTTP shim for OpenRouter chat-completion dispatch | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | shipped 2026-05-03; new agent shim at `src/daemon/agents/openrouter.ts` POSTs `/api/v1/chat/completions` with `stream=true` + `stream_options.include_usage`, parses OpenAI-compatible SSE → AgentEvents (text_delta + message_done with native cost/tokens from OpenRouter), honours abort + 10-min timeout. Dispatch hook `pickShimForVoice(lineage, model)` routes any model with `openrouter:` prefix to the HTTP shim regardless of declared lineage; CLI precheck is skipped (auth = secrets table). Voices now insert with `enabled: true` since dispatch works. |
| Phase composition UI (drag/reorder, edit prompts) | 0.7 | 🟡 PARTIAL | per-slot persona binding shipped (PR #17 + #23). Drag-to-reorder, add/remove phases, fork-from-existing still PLANNED. |
| Default chorus-on-chorus template (Sentinel + Cartographer + Accountant + Translator) | 0.7 | 📐 PLANNED | bakes meta-fix |
| Squashed migration push to `chorus-codes/chorus` | 0.7 | ⏳ NEXT | piece-by-piece audit using personas. **Going live ~2026-05-04.** |
| `npm publish @chorus-codes/chorus` | 0.7 | ⏳ NEXT | rotate token after first publish. **Going live ~2026-05-04.** |
| Cleanup `99xAgency/chorus-ship-e2e` sandbox repo | 0.7 | ⏳ TODO | |
| Pre-audit cleanup sweep (12 findings fixed in one go) | 0.7 | ✅ DONE | 2026-05-01 — runner abort/done race, silent-empty doer, attached_files wire-up, builtin seed re-sync, version drift, brief wall, daemon logs, more. See "Pre-flagged" section. |
| **Per-slot fallback voice chain** (HIGH PRIORITY user-pain) | 0.8 | 🔥 NEXT | **Live pain:** when one voice in a multi-voice template errors (quota_exhausted, network, CLI crash), the partial work from other voices is wasted — they have to re-run from scratch alongside whatever voice replaces the failed one. Fix: each phase slot carries a `fallback: voice[]` chain. On retryable errors (`quota_exhausted`, `network`, `timeout`, `cli_failed`), the runner tries the next fallback voice for THAT slot only — other voices' completed work is preserved. Schema: `phases[].voices[].fallback: ['claude-code', 'openrouter:openai/gpt-4', ...]`. Reuses the same persona binding. Surfaces in PhaseEditor as a "+ add fallback" affordance under each voice slot. **Forces lineage-diversity rule into the chain** — fallback voices should default to same lineage as primary (so quorum math doesn't shift). Dovetails with multi-account-per-CLI: a fallback can be the same CLI on a different account when `CHORUS_CODEX_HOME` rotation is wired up. |
| `chorus audit <persona> <file>` CLI shorthand | 0.8 | 💭 IDEA | wraps `invoke_persona` MCP call; ~30 lines in `src/cli/index.ts`; saves typing the JSON in editors/conversations |
| Cockpit edit UI for builtin templates | 0.8 | ⏳ TODO | POST /templates upsert is now safe (preserves source=builtin); editor itself still missing — designed not built |
| Runner decoupling from SSE — background runChat + event bus replay | 0.8 | ⏳ TODO | surgical fix landed for v0.7 (no auto-abort + chat_done latch); proper fix is fire-on-POST so MCP flows don't sit drafting until a human opens the page |
| Home dashboard (CLI status, usage, reset windows, cost) | 0.8 | 📐 PLANNED | |
| Multi-account per CLI (add N codex / claude / gemini accounts of same vendor) | 0.8 | 📐 PLANNED | first-class UX for what `CHORUS_CODEX_HOME` env hack achieves today; auto-rotate to a non-rate-limited account when one hits quota_exhausted; surfaces in home dashboard alongside reset-window per-account |
| Run history + cost aggregates | 0.8 | 📐 PLANNED | |
| Template marketplace (Stripe + revenue share) | 0.9 | 📐 PLANNED | |
| Local LLM voices (Ollama, llama.cpp) | 1.0+ | 💭 IDEA | |
| CI integration (`chorus review --pr 1234`) | 1.0+ | 💭 IDEA | |

Legend: ✅ done · ⏳ in flight · 🔥 high-priority next · 🟡 partial · 📐 designed · 💭 idea

> **Where we are (2026-05-03):** v0.7 substrate is essentially complete — voices, personas, review-only, token capture, cost surfacing, per-slot persona binding, runner-on-POST, SSE robustness all shipped. Last v0.7 mile: OpenRouter inline (in flight), then squash + publish to `chorus-codes/chorus`. **Going live ~2026-05-04.**

---

## v0.6 — Public launch (DONE 2026-05-01)

Shipped:
- Audit-fix sweep — 7 real bugs caught dogfooding pre-publish (build asset copy, fresh-DB migration, MCP id↔chatId, CLI auto-detect, chorus start in dist, web spawn, postinstall hint)
- Cross-platform CLI detection — `where` on Windows + `which` on Unix, 8 fallback install dirs per OS, `--version` smoke test
- Manual path entry — when auto-detect misses, user pastes the path to the binary and chorus validates
- Reset → reinstall verified end-to-end via `npm pack` + `npm install -g <tarball>`
- Postinstall hint UX with state-aware help banner

---

## v0.7 — Voices · Personas · Phases (CURRENT)

The big one. Cracks the marketplace open.

### 1. Personas (DONE)

**Storage:** `personas` table seeded from `prompts/personas/*.md` on daemon startup. Built-in rows refresh from file source-of-truth on every boot; user-cloned rows (`builtin = 0`) are never overwritten.

**Built-in library** (full prompts in [`prompts/personas/`](prompts/personas/)):

| Persona | One-liner | Recommended lineage |
|---|---|---|
| **Sentinel** | Hunts secrets, injection, broken auth, supply-chain risk | anthropic |
| **Conservator** | Spots when a change fights the existing pattern instead of joining it | openai |
| **Cartographer** | Catches Windows/macOS/Linux assumptions, path separators, line endings, encoding | google |
| **Profiler** | N+1 queries, big-O cliffs, cold-path costs, latency budgets | openai |
| **Translator** | Reviews labels, errors, empty states, help text — for layman users, not engineers | anthropic |
| **Accountant** | Asks "who pays for this, when, and is there bill shock?" | anthropic |
| **Concierge** | Time-to-first-success — install path, error legibility, docs alignment | anthropic |
| **Quartermaster** | Scrutinizes every new dep — maintenance, license, transitive footprint, install scripts | openai |
| **Inspector** | Identifies what's not tested but should be — and what's tested but worthless | openai |
| **Librarian** | Reads README, marketing copy, help text alongside the diff and flags every lie | anthropic |

Each prompt is a *worldview*, not a checklist — single role, list of red flags to actively hunt, and an out-of-scope guard so personas don't bleed into each other's lanes.

**MCP surface** (live now):

- `list_personas()` → `{ personas: [{id, label, oneLiner, recommendedLineage, builtin}] }`
- `invoke_persona({personaId, brief, repoPath?, files?, template?})` → `{chatId, status, url}` — fires a real chat with the persona's system_prompt prepended to the user's brief.

> ✅ **Per-slot persona binding shipped 2026-05-02** (PR #17 969dca5 + PR #23 4ac8cdc). Templates now carry a `persona` field on each phase row, so a single template can route Cartographer → Discover, Sentinel → Develop, Accountant → Decide. The PhaseEditor UI exposes a per-slot persona picker. `invoke_persona` still works as the single-persona-overlay shorthand for ad-hoc audits, but the marketplace-blocking gap is closed. Drag-to-reorder + fork-from-existing remain on §5 (planned).

### 2. Voices (DONE 2026-05-02 — PR #2 c758e80)

Shipped: `voices` table with `(id, label, source, provider, model_id, lineage, vendor_family, input_cost_per_mtok, output_cost_per_mtok, enabled)`. Auto-populated on daemon boot — Phase 1 (sync, pre-listen) seeds single-model CLIs with immutable IDs (`claude-code`, `codex-cli`, …); Phase 2 (background, post-listen) shells `opencode models` for multi-model OpenCode voices. First-boot migration from `<lineage>.enabled_models` settings preserves prior toggles. Lineage stays in existing 5-enum; `vendor_family` carries the finer taxonomy (deepseek/meta/mistral/xai). Full GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes; 6 UI surfaces (home fleet cards, /connect, onboarding, phase-editor) read from `/voices`. See [planning/voices.md](planning/voices.md).

### 3. Review-only mode (DONE 2026-05-02 — PR #4 b21a4b8)

A new phase kind, `review_only`, that takes the artifact as runtime input and skips doer spawn entirely. The unlock for `/work` and other harnesses to call chorus as a pure review service: `MCP create_chat({template: "review-only", artifact: <diff/draft/blob>})`.

Shipped:
- **Schema** — `PhaseSchema` is now a discriminated union by `kind`. `review_only` variant requires `reviewer` + `artifact { label, hint, maxBytes (default 1 MiB) }` instead of a doer block. `.refine` rejects hybrid templates (review_only mixed with standard) at parse time.
- **Runner** — `runReviewOnlyPhase` writes the artifact synthetically as the doer answer, emits synthetic `phase_start`/`phase_progress` events with `agent: 'artifact'`, then runs reviewers via the existing pool with `iterate.maxRounds = 1`. Single pass — no retry. Ship phase force-skipped (no doer diff to commit).
- **DB** — `chats.artifact TEXT` (nullable; capped by template) + `chats.verdict TEXT` (nullable; persisted from `chat_done` so list views can distinguish `verdict='request_changes'` from `verdict='approved'`). Both via idempotent `ADD COLUMN`.
- **Endpoint** — `POST /chats` validates artifact: required when first phase is `review_only`, rejected for non-review-only templates, capped at the template's `maxBytes`.
- **MCP** — `create_chat` gains optional `artifact` param.
- **Cockpit** — "Review only" pill in the template picker. Form swaps task ↔ artifact textarea (monospace, taller, hint placeholder, byte-cap badge). Doer indicator + repo-path block hidden. Run page hides the doer card and round indicators (single pass — no rounds to disambiguate).
- **`buildReviewerAsk` cap raised 2 KB → 256 KB** byte-aware (walks back UTF-8 continuation bytes so multi-byte runes aren't split into U+FFFD). Pre-existing legacy cap was silently truncating any review > ~50 lines; review-only mode just made it impossible to ignore.
- **Verdict surfacing** — `chat_done` now reports the real reviewer consensus (`approved` vs `request_changes`) instead of always `approved`. Standard templates untouched (verdict-tracking only kicks in when a review-only phase ran).
- **Built-in template** — `templates/review-only.yaml` (codex + gemini + claude reviewers, `require: 2`, `crossLineage: true`, `ship.enabled: false`).

Built using its own substrate as the dogfood gate — each commit was reviewed by the new template before the next built on it. Round-2 triage caught 4 real bugs (abort race, ship-skip enforcement, UTF-8 boundary, hybrid validation) all fixed in-branch. 18 new tests; 216/216 passing.

Out of scope (deferred):
- Multi-pass review-only with cockpit-driven revision loop. Today: revise yourself, resubmit a fresh chat.
- `chorus run` / `chorus review` CLI subcommands. Substrate ready; CLI wiring tracked separately in [`planning/cli-task-surface.md`](planning/cli-task-surface.md).

### 4. OpenRouter inline (NEXT — builds on voices)

**UX flow** on the OpenRouter row in onboarding/Settings:

```
┌─ OpenRouter ─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [sk-or-...........]  [Validate & list models] │
│ ✓ Validated. 327 models available.            │

│   2 selected. Save & add as voices.           │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Mechanics:**

- New endpoint `POST /providers/openrouter/validate` body `{key}`:
  - Calls `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
  - On 200 → returns model list (id, lineage, context, input_cost, output_cost)
  - On 401 → `{ok: false, error: "Invalid OpenRouter key"}`
  - On network fail → graceful timeout error
- Frontend caches the model list for the session (no re-fetch per re-render).
- User selects N models. On Save:
  - Upsert secret `openrouter` with the key
  - Insert N rows into `voices` table
- Voices table becomes the canonical source for the template designer's voice picker. CLI subs auto-populate the same table on first detect.

**Lineage tagging** — each OpenRouter model belongs to a lineage (anthropic / openai / google / meta / moonshot / deepseek / mistral / xai). Critical for chorus's diversity story.

**Cost surfacing** — per-1M-token costs shown in picker. Template designer later shows "this template will cost ~$X per run" (sum of expected tokens × per-model cost). Avoids the bill-shock failure mode.

### 5. Phase composition (PARTIAL — per-slot persona binding shipped 2026-05-02)

The §1 limitation is gone — PR #17 wired persona into doer + reviewer slots and PR #23 added the per-slot picker UI. Each phase row now owns its own `(voice, persona)` pair, so templates route Cartographer → Discover, Sentinel → Develop, Accountant → Decide out of the box.

Still PLANNED for full §5 (drag-reorder, add/remove phases, fork-from-existing):

```
phase {
  position: 0,
  phase_kind: "review",  // doer | review | synthesis | decide
  voice_id: "openrouter:moonshotai/kimi-k2",
  persona_id: "cartographer",
  prompt_overrides: { ... }   // overrides on top of persona system_prompt
}
```

UI: drag-to-reorder, add/remove phases, fork from existing template. Token inserts in prompts: `{{user_brief}}`, `{{prior_phase_outputs}}`, `{{repo_diff}}`, `{{file_path}}`.

### 5b. Round-2 deferred items (4-of-4 DONE 2026-05-02)

The four warmup items from [`planning/round-2-deferred.md`](planning/round-2-deferred.md) all shipped in a single autonomous session, each as its own PR + dogfooded via the new review-only template. Both Claude and Gemini reviewers caught real bugs in 3 of 4 dogfoods; round-1 fixes pushed before merge.

- ✅ **§2 Per-phase `timeoutMs` override** — PR #5 (9a47f23). Optional integer field on both `StandardPhase` and `ReviewOnlyPhase` schemas (30s..1h bounds) that overrides the default phase wait budget. Threaded through `runDoerHeadless`, `runReviewerHeadless`, both tmux paths' `waitForAnswer`, and the review-only synthetic StandardPhase. Round-1 dogfood flagged the magic-literal `5*60*1000` in tmux paths vs the named `DEFAULT_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS` in headless — fixed by extracting `DEFAULT_TMUX_PHASE_TIMEOUT_MS` sibling constant with a comment explaining why tmux is tighter (file-watch polling vs subprocess wall).
- ✅ **§4 Opt-out telemetry heartbeat** — PR #6 (bac7445). Daemon-side ping to `chorus.codes` once on boot + every 24h. Fixed payload (`schema/installId/version/os/arch/node/daemonUptimeSeconds/chatsLast24h`) — no chat content, no PII, no file/repo paths. Three opt-out paths: `CHORUS_TELEMETRY=0|false|no|off`, `~/.chorus/no-telemetry`, settings flag. Round-1 caught a critical unhandled-rejection bug (`buildPayload` ran outside `sendHeartbeat`'s try/catch — a libsql disconnect during shutdown could crash the daemon); fixed by wrapping the whole body. Plus install-id mode tightened to 0o600 and timers `.unref()`'d so the daemon can exit naturally. Server endpoint at `chorus.codes/api/telemetry` + `/privacy` page deploy are separate infra tasks.
- ✅ **§3 Structured JSON-line logger substrate** — PR #7 (7ce6b46). Pino-shaped wire format (numeric `level`, `time`, `pid`, `hostname`) so a future swap to pino is transparent for downstream consumers. No runtime dependency added. Child loggers bake correlation fields (`chatId`/`phase`/`role`/`lineage`/`requestId`) into every emitted line. `CHORUS_LOG_LEVEL` env gate. Round-1 dogfood caught 3 real bugs: clobberable `ts`/`level` (user fields could overwrite core wire shape), `JSON.stringify` throws on circular refs/BigInt/hostile `toJSON` (logger should never throw — now wrapped with `safeStringify` and a degraded fallback), and `Error` instances serialized to `{}` (now expanded to `{message,name,stack,cause?}`). Five first-class call sites wired in `src/daemon/index.ts`; the mechanical migration of the remaining ~50 `console.log` sites is a follow-up.
- ✅ **§1 Token-capture rails** — PR #8 (3910607). Smallest viable substrate: `AgentEvent.message_done` extended with optional `usage: {inputTokens, outputTokens, cachedInputTokens}`, captured into `runDoerHeadless`'s return shape. Per-lineage parser updates (claude `result.usage`, codex `assistant_done`, gemini `*TokenCount`), DB persistence destination, cost computation from `voices.input_cost_per_mtok`, reviewer-side capture, and cockpit token display all deferred to focused follow-up PRs so each can land independently.

### 6. Default chorus-on-chorus template (PLANNED)

Hard-codes Sentinel + Cartographer + Accountant + Translator as the four reviewer slots in chorus's own audit template. The next person reviewing chorus *can't* skip those four lenses — bakes the meta-lessons into the product.

### 7. Migration to chorus-codes (NEXT)

After v0.7 ships:

1. Piece-by-piece audit via MCP — fire personas against critical files (`src/cli/index.ts`, `src/daemon/runner.ts`, etc.) using real chorus chats. The audit is the dogfood demo.
2. Findings → cleanup branch → squashed push to `chorus-codes/chorus` (single clean snapshot, no 99xAgency history).
3. Update `package.json` `name` → `@chorus-codes/chorus`, repository + bugs URLs.
4. `npm publish --access public`. Rotate token after first publish.
5. Cleanup `99xAgency/chorus-ship-e2e` sandbox repo.

## Pre-flagged for migration audit

Drift bugs / risks spotted in passing — most fixed 2026-05-01 in a single sweep before the migration audit even ran (the AUDIT prep itself surfaced 12 findings).

### Fixed 2026-05-01 (post-first-audit sweep)

The first cartographer audit attempt revealed 5 more findings — most caught while the doer was still running, then the system load spiked because the actual root cause (#17) was hammering the LLM CLIs. All 5 fixed before re-running the audit.

- ✅ **#13 Persona-composed brief dominated every chat title** — `mcp__chorus__invoke_persona` writes `# Persona: <Label>\n\n<system_prompt>\n---\n# User request\n\n<brief>` into `chat.work`. Sidebar/run page truncated by char count, so every Cartographer chat looked identical (200 chars of persona prompt). New helper at [`src/lib/chat-title.ts`](src/lib/chat-title.ts) `chatDisplayTitle()` parses the wrapper and returns `[<Persona>] <user request>`. Wired into sidebar, /runs list, and run page heading. Non-persona chats fall through unchanged.
- ✅ **#15 Phase stepper showed "DONE" while doer was still drafting** — the run-artifacts API ([`src/app/api/run-artifacts/[chatId]/route.ts`](src/app/api/run-artifacts/[chatId]/route.ts)) treated *file existence* as `hasAnswer`, but the runner pre-creates an empty `answer.md` at spawn time so live tail can poll. Now `hasAnswer` requires non-empty content (`answer.trim().length > 0`).
- ✅ **#16 Duplicate `phase_events` rows for the same phase** — observed 4× drafting + 10× blocked rows on a single chat. Root cause was the same as #17 (multiple concurrent runChats); fixing #17 eliminates it. No additional dedup needed in `phaseEvents.create` — the singleton invariant guarantees each event fires exactly once.
- ✅ **#17 (CRITICAL) — every SSE re-attach spawned a fresh runChat** — browser refresh, opening the run page in a second tab, MCP `wait_for_chat`, sidebar polling: each one called `GET /chats/:id/stream` which awaited a fresh `runChat()`. With code-review template that's 1 doer + 2 reviewers = 3 LLM CLI subprocesses *per SSE connection*, all writing to the same `answer.md` file, all consuming hundreds of MB. Hit load avg 133 with 8.5G swap full when 4-5 SSEs piled up on the same chat. Fix in [`src/daemon/index.ts`](src/daemon/index.ts): `Map<chatId, ActiveRun>` registry. First SSE wins → fires `runWithMultiplex` which runs `runChat` once and broadcasts events to a `Set<SubscriberFn>`. Subsequent SSEs subscribe to the existing run + replay past events from `phase_events`. Terminal-state chats just replay + close. POST `/chats/:id/cancel` and DELETE `/chats/:id` now also call `entry.abortController.abort()` so cancel kills the actual LLM CLI processes (was previously DB-only).
- ✅ **Daemon log verified end-to-end** — `[daemon] seeded 10 built-in personas` + `Chorus daemon listening on http://127.0.0.1:7707` now appear in `~/.chorus/logs/daemon.log` (vs previously /dev/null).

### Fixed 2026-05-01 (pre-audit sweep)

- ✅ **#1 `seedBuiltinTemplates()` doesn't update existing rows** — [`src/daemon/index.ts`](src/daemon/index.ts) `seedBuiltinTemplates`. Now mirrors the personas seed pattern: re-syncs builtin rows from disk on every daemon boot when YAML differs from DB. User-cloned rows (`source='user'`) are never overwritten.
- ✅ **#2 `POST /templates` silently demoted builtins to user-source** — [`src/daemon/index.ts`](src/daemon/index.ts) POST /templates handler. Now reads existing row first; if `source='builtin'`, the upsert preserves it. New rows still default to `source='user'`. Combined with #1, YAML source-of-truth is now authoritative for builtins.
- ✅ **#4 `attached_files` was dead state** — runner now reads chat.attached_files, packs each file (≤64 KB, ≤256 KB total) into a `## Attached files` block, and inlines it into both doer + every reviewer prompt. `invoke_persona({files: [...]})` finally works as documented.
- ✅ **#5 `readfile()` returns BLOB, Zod rejected** — DB layer at [`src/lib/db/index.ts`](src/lib/db/index.ts) `coerceTemplateYaml` now coerces Buffer→string at the read boundary. Direct SQL writes via `readfile()` no longer poison the daemon.
- ✅ **#6 Cockpit sidebar version was hardcoded** — [`src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`](src/components/app-sidebar.tsx) now fetches version from `/health` on mount and falls back to `—` when daemon is offline. No more drift between bumps.
- ✅ **#7 Run page rendered the entire brief as a wall of text** — [`src/components/live-run-real.tsx`](src/components/live-run-real.tsx) `BriefHeading` collapses briefs >200 chars to a one-line summary with "Show full brief" expander.
- ✅ **#8b Doer reported success on empty output** — [`src/daemon/runner.ts`](src/daemon/runner.ts) `runDoerHeadless`. Returns null when stream ended with no `message_done` AND no accumulated text, regardless of whether an error event fired. Catches CLI exits where stdout was unparseable, abort killed the process early, or the SDK ended silently.
- ✅ **#8c `phase_failed` events lacked `kind`, fell back to `plan`** — both phase_failed emission sites in [`src/daemon/runner.ts`](src/daemon/runner.ts) now include `phaseIdx`, `kind`, `role`. DB rows now reflect actual pipeline phase, not the schema fallback.
- ✅ **#9 `POST /chats` hardcoded `phase_kind: 'plan'`** — [`src/daemon/index.ts`](src/daemon/index.ts) now reads `template.phases[0].kind` for the initial drafting event. Falls back to 'plan' only on parse error. Verified live with a `code-review` chat creating `phase_kind: review` correctly.
- ✅ **#11 Runner only fired when SSE was opened, not on POST /chats** — combined with #12, was the proximate cause of the silent-approval bug. Mitigated by **#12 fix** below; full runner-decoupling deferred to v0.8 (see below).
- ✅ **#12 Abort/chat_done race overwrote `cancelled` with `approved`** — [`src/daemon/runner.ts`](src/daemon/runner.ts) `emitChatDone` is now a one-way latch: first emission wins. Plus [`src/daemon/index.ts`](src/daemon/index.ts) SSE handler no longer auto-aborts on connection close — closing a tab ≠ cancelling a chat. Explicit cancel still goes through `POST /chats/:id/cancel`. Plus a new `anyPhaseDoerFailed` flag terminates the chat as `failed` (not `approved`) when no doer ever produced real output.
- ✅ **Daemon stdio was `/dev/null`** — debugging silent failures was impossible. [`src/cli/index.ts`](src/cli/index.ts) `chorus start` now pipes daemon + cockpit stdio to `~/.chorus/logs/{daemon,web}.log`. Confirmed: `[daemon] seeded 10 built-in personas` now visible.

### Deferred — substantial work

- ⏳ **#3 Cockpit UI for editing builtin templates** — `src/app/templates/page.tsx` is still read-only. With #2 now safe (POST won't demote builtins), the missing piece is the editor itself. Designed but not implemented: in-page YAML editor with validate-on-save, "Fork to user template" button, voice/persona/quorum picker (depends on Voices abstraction in v0.7-final). Target: v0.8.
- ✅ **Runner decoupling from SSE (#11 properly)** — shipped 2026-05-02 in PR #21 (b372bec). `runChat` now fires in a background async task on POST /chats; SSE is a passive subscriber on a per-chat event bus that replays past events from `phase_events`. MCP-driven flows (`invoke_persona` from Claude Code/Codex/Cursor) no longer sit in `drafting` until a human opens the URL.

## v0.8 — Per-slot fallback voice chain (HIGH PRIORITY)

**The pain (live, observed 2026-05-03):** when one voice in a multi-voice template errors mid-run (codex `quota_exhausted` until next reset, gemini network blip, claude CLI crash, opencode subprocess kill), today the runner reports the slot as `errored` and the *other voices' completed reviews* are wasted — re-running the chat re-fires every voice from scratch. With a 4-voice review template that's 3 wasted ~$X reviews because of one bad subscription.

**The fix:** every phase slot owns a `fallback: voice[]` chain. On a retryable error class (`quota_exhausted | network | timeout | cli_failed`), the runner swaps in the next fallback voice **for that slot only**. The completed work from other voices is preserved — no global re-run.

**Schema** (additive on top of the per-slot persona binding from PR #17 + #23):

```yaml
phases:
  - kind: review_only
    reviewers:
      - voice: codex-cli           # primary
        persona: sentinel
        fallback:                  # tried in order on retryable error
          - openrouter:openai/gpt-5.5
          - claude-code
      - voice: gemini-cli
        persona: cartographer
        fallback:
          - openrouter:google/gemini-3-pro
      - voice: opencode-go         # no fallback declared — error stays errored
        persona: accountant
```

**Behaviour rules:**

- **Retryable errors only** — `cli_warning` and non-terminal events do NOT trigger fallback. Only the four error kinds above. Schema validation errors, hostile-stream writer-died, etc. stay terminal because the underlying problem is the prompt or environment, not the voice.
- **One fallback exhaustion at a time** — runner tries fallback[0]. If that also errors retryably, tries fallback[1]. Once the chain is empty, the slot is terminal `errored`. Quorum math then runs on whoever did succeed (e.g. `require: 2 of 3` still passes if 2 succeeded and 1 exhausted its chain).
- **Lineage diversity preserved by default** — PhaseEditor warns if a fallback differs in lineage from the primary (so quorum math doesn't silently shift from "2 lineages agree" to "all 3 are anthropic"). User can override with explicit acknowledgement.
- **No re-run of already-finished voices** — the partial event log is authoritative. The runner inspects `phase_events` for the slot, sees primary errored, dispatches the fallback to the same persona+brief without touching the others.
- **Cost attribution** — both primary attempt and fallback attempt log their own `cost_usd` rows. Run history shows "voice swap due to quota_exhausted" inline so the user understands why their bill has two charges for one slot.
- **MCP visibility** — `chat_done` payload gains `voiceSwaps: [{slot, from, to, reason}]` so MCP harnesses can decide whether the swap fundamentally changes the verdict semantics.

**UX surfaces:**

- PhaseEditor: each voice row gets a "+ add fallback" chevron. Drag-to-reorder within the chain. Lineage warning badge when chain crosses lineages.
- Run page: when a swap fires, the participant card shows a small "→ swapped to <fallback>" pill instead of disappearing. Both attempts visible in the round expander.
- Onboarding: when a user has only ONE voice in a lineage, the post-add nudge suggests "Add an OpenRouter fallback so a quota hit doesn't kill your runs."

**Dovetails with:**

- **Multi-account per CLI** (also v0.8): a fallback can be the same CLI on a different `CHORUS_CODEX_HOME` account. So Codex with quota A → Codex with quota B → OpenRouter `openai/*`. First-class UX once the `cli_account` table lands.
- **OpenRouter inline** (in flight PR #27): API-routed fallbacks become trivial once the dispatch shim ships. The roadmap-level value of OpenRouter is partly about being the universal-fallback layer.

**Effort:** ~3 days. Schema + parser + runner dispatch swap + PhaseEditor UI + 2 cockpit surfaces. Tests cover: retryable-classification, chain-exhaustion-then-quorum-still-passes, lineage-warning, cost-double-attribution, no-re-run-of-others.

## v0.8 — Home dashboard (PLANNED)

A live overview of your model fleet. Answers "what do I have, what am I burning, when do my limits reset."

**Scope:**
- **CLI status panel** — per CLI: installed/healthy, version, last-used, recent error count
- **Usage & reset windows** — for each subscription:
  - Tokens consumed this period
  - Period reset time (Claude Pro 5h windows, Codex daily caps, Gemini quotas)
  - Visualised as filling-bar with countdown
- **Cost tracking** — per-run, per-template, per-day:
  - CLI sub usage shown in "shadow $" (list-price equivalent for capacity planning)
  - API usage shown in real $
  - Aggregate dashboard with breakdown by voice, by template, by phase
- **Health pings** — heartbeat per CLI every N minutes, surfaces "claude is unhealthy" before a run fails
- **Multi-account per CLI** — power users hit weekly/daily plan limits and want to round-robin across multiple ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini accounts. Today the `CHORUS_CODEX_HOME` env override (PR #9) is a single-account stopgap. v0.8 brings: a `cli_account` table `(id, cli, label, home_path, enabled, priority)`, an Add Account UI on `/connect` that scaffolds `~/.codex-<label>/` and runs `codex login` in a tmux side-pane, automatic rotation when a voice's active account emits `quota_exhausted` (the in-flight PR #9 already surfaces this event), and per-account reset-window display in the dashboard above. Same shape extends to claude (`~/.claude-<label>/`) and gemini (`~/.gemini-<label>/`).
- **Run history** — last 50 chats with status, voices used, total cost, duration

**Storage:** new tables `voice_usage`, `cost_event`, `cli_health_ping`, `cli_account`.

**Effort:** ~1 week.

---

## v0.9 — Template Marketplace (PLANNED)

Foundations for shareable / sellable templates.

- Public `chorus.codes/templates` directory
- Author profiles, install count, ratings, tags
- One-click install: `chorus template install <slug>`
- Free tier: open templates, anyone can share
- Premium tier: gated templates, Stripe integration, revenue share with author
- Signing & verification (templates are config + prompts, but supply chain still matters)

**Effort:** ~3 weeks (auth + payments + moderation).

---

## v1.0+ — Future (IDEAS)

- **Custom phase types** — users can define new phase kinds beyond review/doer/synthesis
- **Conditional phases** — "only run Sentinel if repo has API endpoints"
- **Multi-repo templates** — review changes across a monorepo or set of services
- **CI integration** — `chorus review --pr 1234` runs your template against any GitHub PR
- **Local LLM voices** — Ollama, llama.cpp as voices (offline / private)

---

## Website plan

`chorus.codes` needs a **Templates** section to sell the v0.7+ story:

1. **Hero update** — replace generic "multi-LLM peer review" with "Voices × Personas × Phases. Build your own. Or use one that wins."
2. **Templates page** (`/templates`) — gallery view:
   - Featured templates (curated): "React Refactor", "Solidity Audit", "API Design", "Copy Review", "Migration Plan"
   - Each card: voices used (lineage badges), personas, expected runtime, expected cost
3. **Personas page** (`/personas`) — the 10 built-in personas, what they hunt for, what they ignore. Sells the worldview-as-prompt idea.
4. **Author page** (post-marketplace) — top template authors with revenue stats.

## Storage schema (target — v0.7 final)

```sql
-- Voices: every routable model
CREATE TABLE voices (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  label TEXT NOT NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL,                -- "cli" | "api"
  provider TEXT NOT NULL,
  model_id TEXT,
  lineage TEXT NOT NULL,
  input_cost_per_mtok REAL,
  output_cost_per_mtok REAL,
  enabled INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Personas: the worldview a reviewer wears (LIVE)
CREATE TABLE personas (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  label TEXT NOT NULL,
  one_liner TEXT NOT NULL,
  system_prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
  recommended_lineage TEXT,
  builtin INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  forked_from TEXT REFERENCES personas(id),
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Phases: per-template phase definitions (replaces hardcoded phases)
CREATE TABLE template_phases (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  template_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES templates(id),
  position INTEGER NOT NULL,
  phase_kind TEXT NOT NULL,            -- "doer" | "review" | "synthesis" | "decide"
  voice_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES voices(id),
  persona_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES personas(id),
  prompt_overrides TEXT,
  UNIQUE (template_id, position)
);
```

Migration of pre-v0.7 templates: convert each existing phase to a row with `persona_id = 'generic-reviewer'` (an 11th built-in for backwards compat), preserving voice assignments.

---

## MCP surface (target — v0.7 final)

```typescript
// LIVE
list_personas() → { personas: Persona[] }
invoke_persona({personaId, brief, repoPath?, files?, template?}) → ChatRef
create_chat({work, template?, files?, artifact?}) → ChatRef
   // artifact required when template's first phase is review_only

// PLANNED
list_voices() → { voices: Voice[] }
list_templates() → { templates: Template[] }   // already live
run_template({templateId, brief, repoPath?, voiceOverrides?}) → ChatRef
```

Use case: from inside Claude Code, user types *"Ask chorus to have Sentinel and Cartographer review this branch"* → MCP fires two `invoke_persona` calls in parallel → cockpit shows both reviews live → results flow back into the editor.
